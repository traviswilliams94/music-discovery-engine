## Project Pitch: 
A basic UI for creating spotify playlists or browsing metadata on spotify.
Displays tracks based on user input and allows the user to select tracks for a playlist.

## User Stories:

1. as a user, I want there to be a homepage where i can choose what part of the app to use

2. as a user, I can discover tracks by genre and select them to add to a playlist

3. as a user, I can get a list of related artists by searching an artist (or a random string!)

4. as a user, I can view a playlist that I've created on the page, *and be able to use that playlist in spotify *(dependent on OAuth)
