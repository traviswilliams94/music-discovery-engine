## Project Pitch: 
A basic UI for creating spotify playlists or browsing metadata on spotify.
Displays tracks based on user input and allows the user to select tracks for a playlist.

## User Stories:

1. as a user, I want there to be a homepage where i can choose what part of the app to use

2. as a user, I can discover tracks by genre/track/artist and select them to add to a playlist

3. as a user, I can generate a random list of tracks and select them to add to a playlist

4. as a user, I can view a playlist that I've created on the page, and be able to use that playlist in spotify (dependent on OAuth)
